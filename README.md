<h1>My Vision Board</h1>

<p>In the past, I was very interested in observing how people interacted with each other. I often focused on the underlying dynamics that shaped those interactions, <strong>not just what was visible on the surface.</strong> When I was 13, I also developed a strong curiosity for quantum physics, which taught me to think in abstract and systemic ways. Both interests influenced how I approach knowledge and problem-solving today.</p>

<h2>Present Development</h2>

<ul>
    <li> At present, I study Psychology.</li>
    <li> In parallel, I am involved in two technical and linguistic programs that strengthen my analytical reasoning and precision in communication. My current path combines human and computational systems, allowing me to understand structure, logic, and complexity from different perspectives.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Goals</h2>
<p>In the future, I see myself completing my English proficiency in 2026, graduating as a Software Analyst and Developer in 2027, and finishing my Psychology degree in 2028. My goal is to integrate these disciplines to create efficient, adaptable solutions across human and technological contexts. I focus on versatility and structured thinking as the basis of my professional vision.</p>
